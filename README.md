#A Webiste GUI For A Minigame




- People using the Webiste Interface are either observers or Gamemakers
- Each Gamemaker has a rating score so people can vote and decide who were the best game makers
- Head Gamemaker can go into the game and do changes (however needs limited power for not trolling)
